# Crypto Exchange Compliance Dashboard

A full-stack regulatory compliance management tool built for cryptocurrency exchanges operating under U.S. money transmission and BSA/AML obligations. Designed to surface compliance gaps, track remedial actions, and monitor license status across jurisdictions — the kind of visibility a Chief Compliance Officer actually needs.

## Why This Exists

Crypto exchanges face a patchwork of state Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs), ongoing BSA/AML program obligations, and regulatory examination findings that generate remedial action backlogs. Most compliance teams manage this in spreadsheets. This dashboard centralizes it into a real-time, auditable system.
